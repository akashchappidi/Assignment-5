        "ASSIGNMENT\n",
        "1) What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "-->Interpreted: Code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter, making it more flexible but generally slower.\n",
        "Compiled: Code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, resulting in faster performance but less flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2)What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "-->Exception handling is a mechanism to gracefully deal with errors that occur during program execution, such as invalid input or missing files.\n",
        "It uses try, except, finally blocks to catch and handle exceptions, preventing the program from crashing unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3)What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "-->The finally block in Python's exception handling guarantees the execution of certain code, such as resource cleanup (e.g., closing files), irrespective of whether an exception occurs within the try block or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4) What is logging in Python?\n",
        "-->Logging in Python is a mechanism for recording events and messages that occur during program execution. It provides a structured way to track errors, debug issues, and monitor the behavior of your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "--> The __del__ method, also known as the destructor, is a special method in Python that is called just before an object is garbage collected. It provides a mechanism for performing any necessary cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing external resources, before the object is permanently removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6) What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "-->import: Imports the entire module into the current namespace, requiring you to use the module name as a prefix (e.g., module_name.function()).\n",
        "from ... import: Imports specific objects (functions, classes, variables) directly into the current namespace, allowing you to use them without the module name prefix (e.g., function()).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7) How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "-->You can handle multiple exceptions in Python using multiple except blocks, each specifying a different exception type. Alternatively, you can use a single except block with a tuple of exception types to catch multiple exceptions in a concise way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8) What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "-->The with statement in Python simplifies file handling by automatically closing the file object even if exceptions occur within the with block. This ensures that resources are properly released, preventing potential errors and improving code maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9) What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "-->Multithreading: Executes multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space. Suitable for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Creates multiple processes, each with its own memory space. Better for CPU-bound tasks as it avoids the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10) What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "-->Logging provides valuable insights into program behavior, aiding in debugging, monitoring, and understanding application performance. It helps identify and troubleshoot errors, track user activity, and analyze system usage patterns, enabling proactive maintenance and improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11) What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "-->Python's memory management handles allocation and deallocation of memory for objects automatically. It uses techniques like reference counting and garbage collection to efficiently manage memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks and simplifying development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12)What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "-->try block: Enclose the code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "except block: Handle the raised exception by providing appropriate error handling logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13) Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "-->Efficient memory management in Python prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures the stability and reliability of applications by preventing unexpected crashes due to insufficient memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14) What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "-->try block: Contains the code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "except block: Handles the raised exception by executing specific code to recover or gracefully exit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15) How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "-->Python uses a combination of reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to reclaim memory. Reference counting tracks the number of references to an object. When the count reaches zero, the object is immediately deallocated. The cyclic garbage collector handles cases where objects form circular references, preventing memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16)What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "-->The else block in exception handling executes only if no exception occurs within the corresponding try block. It's useful for code that should run only when the try block completes successfully without encountering any errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17)What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "-->Common logging levels in Python include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, representing increasing severity of events. You can configure your logger to filter messages based on these levels, allowing you to control the amount of log information generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18)What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "-->os.fork(): Creates a child process that is an exact copy of the parent process, including memory and file descriptors. Primarily used for system-level forking.\n",
        "multiprocessing: Provides a higher-level API for creating and managing multiple processes, including features like process pools and message queues, making it easier to write concurrent programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19)What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "-->Closing a file explicitly using file_object.close() ensures that all buffered data is written to the file and system resources associated with the file are released, preventing potential data loss, resource leaks, and errors in subsequent operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20)What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "-->file.read(): Reads the entire content of the file into a single string. If you provide an argument (number of bytes), it reads that specific number of bytes.\n",
        "\n",
        "file.readline(): Reads a single line from the file, including the newline character (\\n), and returns it as a string. It reads from the current position in the file up to the next newline character.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21) What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "-->The logging module in Python is used to generate and manage log messages during program execution. It provides a flexible and configurable way to record events, debug issues, and monitor application behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22) What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "-->The os module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including file system operations. It's used for tasks like:\n",
        "\n",
        "Path manipulation: Joining paths, getting file names, checking file existence.\n",
        "File and directory operations: Creating, renaming, deleting files and directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23)What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "-->Circular references: Objects can form circular references, making it difficult for the garbage collector to identify and reclaim unused memory.\n",
        "Memory leaks: Unintentional long-term retention of unused objects can lead to memory exhaustion, impacting performance and stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24)How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "-->raise ValueError(\"Invalid input value\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25)Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "-->Multithreading can significantly improve performance in I/O-bound applications by allowing concurrent execution of I/O operations, such as network requests or file reads/writes, while the main thread continues to process other tasks, making the program more responsive and efficient.\n",
